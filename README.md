WareGraph – Topological Warehouse Layout Optimizer

WareGraph is a **graph-theory–driven warehouse slotting optimizer** that minimizes picker travel distance by intelligently grouping frequently co-ordered products.

The system models warehouse demand as a **co-occurrence graph**, applies **spectral clustering**, and visualizes the improvement through an interactive dashboard.

> 🔥 Designed to demonstrate real-world application of **Graph Algorithms, Data Engineering, and Microservice Architecture**.
